# Feature extraction and voice matching



Welcome to the  Feature extraction and voice matching application repository. 

In this document, the codes used include two parts.

The first part is focused on extracting various sound features such as mfcc, zcr, chroma, energy_envelope

And in the second part, I have tried to use VGG-16 model to compare and match the input sound with a dataset of sample sounds.


- Higher code execution speed compared to the first code sample
- Better voice gender recognition

And I am improving the error and optimizing the code.
