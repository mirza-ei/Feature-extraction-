### README for Voice Matching System

#### Introduction

This voice matching system uses machine learning techniques to identify which of a set of predefined training audio files best matches a given test audio file. The system extracts audio features, normalizes them, trains Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and uses logistic regression for classification. It aims to accurately find the closest match based on extracted audio features.

#### Key Components

1. **Audio Processing:**
   - **Loading Audio:** Uses the `librosa` library to load audio files and extract the raw audio data.
   - **Feature Extraction:** Computes various audio features, including Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Imposed MFCCs (IMFCCs), Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCCs), and Perceptual Nonlinear Cepstral Coefficients (PNCCs).

2. **Feature Normalization:**
   - **Standardization:** Normalizes features by scaling them to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps in reducing bias due to different scales of features.

3. **Model Training:**
   - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs):** Fits GMMs to the extracted and normalized features from the training files. GMMs are used to model the distribution of features in each training file.
   - **Logistic Regression:** Trains a logistic regression classifier using the GMM scores to differentiate between different training files.

4. **Similarity Scoring:**
   - **GMM Scoring:** Calculates the log-likelihood scores of the features from the test audio using the trained GMMs.
   - **Threshold Determination:** Determines a similarity threshold to decide if the test audio sufficiently matches any of the training files.

5. **Matching Process:**
   - **Score Calculation:** Computes similarity scores for the test audio against each training file using the trained GMMs.
   - **Prediction and Matching:** Uses logistic regression to classify the test audio and determine which training file is the best match based on the highest score.

#### Workflow

1. **Setup and Initialization:**
   - Define the paths to the training audio files and the test audio file.

2. **Feature Extraction and Normalization:**
   - Load the audio files and extract features.
   - Normalize these features to prepare them for model training.

3. **Training:**
   - Train GMMs on the normalized features of each training file.
   - Use the GMM scores to train a logistic regression model.

4. **Testing and Matching:**
   - Extract and normalize features from the test audio.
   - Score the test audio against each training file and classify it using the logistic regression model.

5. **Results:**
   - Output the best matching training file based on similarity scores.
   - Provide details on the similarity scores and feature weights.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Loading and Preparing Data:**
   - **Audio Loading:** Load audio data from specified file paths. Handle exceptions if files are not found.
   - **Feature Extraction:** Extract MFCC, IMFCC, LFCC, and PNCC features from the audio. Print shapes of extracted features for verification.

2. **Training Models:**
   - **GMM Training:** Fit GMMs to each feature set. Print convergence status and means of the GMMs.
   - **Logistic Regression Training:** Train the classifier with scaled GMM scores from the training files.

3. **Testing and Evaluation:**
   - **Score Calculation:** Compute GMM scores for test audio features.
   - **Classification:** Use the logistic regression model to classify the test audio and identify the closest match.

4. **Output:**
   - **Match Information:** Print the best match and similarity scores. Provide details on feature weights used in classification.

#### Requirements

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `librosa`
  - `os`

- **Audio Files:**
  - Ensure audio files are in a format supported by `librosa` (e.g., WAV).

#### Usage

1. **Set Up File Paths:**
   - Define paths to the training audio files and the test audio file in the script.

2. **Run the Matching Function:**
   - Call the `match_test_to_train` function with the paths to your training and test audio files.

3. **Review Results:**
   - Check the printed results to determine the best match and similarity scores.
